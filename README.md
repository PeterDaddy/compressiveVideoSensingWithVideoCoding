This project developed a faster encoder and decoder and intra/inter prediction and inverse problem solver software and hardware.
The data structure in this work will be involved in 3D and 4D volumetric, which are traditional distinguishing features that are mostly found in vector-based data structures.

The project has been established to be 3 phases as the following:
  Old DOS execution-style: A basic peripheral for encoding/decoding and software results evaluation will be completed in this phase. In addition, in the end, I plan to include multithreading or GPU support.
  - Including better GUI using PyQT/PySide and cleaning code
  - Hardware solver compatibility on SoC/FPGA for demolishment.
